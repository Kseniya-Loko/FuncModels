texts <- c("Mild tropical fruit aroma. It is over carbonated which is washing away flavour making the beer taste quite thin. Maybe fermented out too much as well. Ubiquitous pithy bitter flavour which is verging on getting rather tiring. Disappointed with this, maybe brewed down to a price point. More burping, definitely over carbonated. (2.0)
Sort of a murky light brown thing...not all the way off this style's appearance but definitely colouring outside the lines in a bad way. The nose is similar - plasticy phenols, maybe some esters. On the palate, it's got a bit of wheaty acidity, but still has a sticky component. The dark malts don't register much or well...the malts in general don't. There's none of the banana-clove stuff I'd expect in this style. Misses the mark, by quite a bit, as it usually the case when a brewer that doesn't specialize in weizen makes one. (2.4)

Kind of clean pink at first, but after swirling the can get redish and thicker like the Clamato, and slightly thinned down by the Bud Light beer. Bubbles are left on the brew, and a film on the glass. Tomato nose with a hint of clam juice - and the Bud that does not really go well, mineralizing things. The taste is better, as the Clamato takes a little over the light beer. I have been a fan of this mix of clam-tomato juice and beer for a while, so I can take this. Not a fan of BL, but better than the regular Bud for mixing, as not as rich of adjuncts. Drinkable, if you are into this mix. (2.2)", "Nice Vienna style lager on tap at George’s in Racine! Rich malty body with well balanced hop touch makes for great mouth feel and taste! Mild malt aroma and finish. Worth a try sure! Prosit! (3.3)
Can. Towering foam atop a lemon-colored, opaque beer. Smells like lemons, too. Drinks with a bit of that lemony essence as well, but without the tartness. Juicy and sweet. (#8071, 10/2021) (3.1)
Pours clear golden with a white and stable head. Aroma is mildly sweetish and malty. Taste is mild as well with flavors of grain, cooked vegetables and a hint of honey. Finish with a nice crispier touch of herbal flavor. Mild but not watery overall. A refreshing and well balanced thirst quencher. Pairs well with many dishes. (Poured from a 0,5l can) (3.2)
500ml draught attending the release of Røykatt at Ølhallen. Hazy dark brown body, filmy layer, spotty lacing on the glassware. Inviting smoked malty aromas, hints of dark dough and bacon. Nicely smoked malty flavours as well, moments of chocolate and bacon. Rounded mid-sweet, lightly smoked ending. Well bodied. Good drinking. (3.5)
Dark amber nearing brown pour. Acidity aroma as well as berries and some funk. Flavour of berries with a hint of lemon and a oak tasting finish. Good amount of sourness. (3.4)
Clear golden colour,. moderate sized creamy white head; aroma of hay, grainy,grassy, some herbal and minimal citrusy notes; well balanced bittersweet taste with some spicy-peppery notes; correct one (2.9)
BB 11.02.22. From a can poured a slightly clouded amber with 1cm of bright white open foam that retained very well and laced very well. carbonation high, very lively and fine to medium. Aroma moderately strong of fresh grassy hops with citrus notes. Taste is subdued flavours; moderately bitter. Light body. Smooth, crisp, clean, refreshing and dry with a lingering finish. Easily sessionable. (3.2)
330ml can. Pours a pale gold with a small white head. Aroma is mild with a slight herbal smell. Beer is light, with a decent malt base, subtle hops & what I assume is the coriander give a mild bitterness but full flavour profile. Lasts well. Interesting but I'm not sure a coriander spice ale is quite what I'm looking for. (3.0)
Can. Citrus aroma (that's for sure!), starch, pale malt. Medium gold/amber color, with a fine-beaded fluffy white head. The shikuwasa is present as a light bitter note from mid palate onward. Curious if they used peel as well as fruit. Not really recognizable as an IPA. Tolerable... but not preferable. (3.0)
Can. Noble hop aroma, with a zesty light pungent stink (which indicates adjuncts). Clear gold straw color, one finger frothy white head, and minimal carbonation. Initial is okay, with some fruitiness. Then the flavors disintegrate and nearly disappear. There is also a salty note near the end, and some metallic hints as well. Rice and Corn and Starch, Oh My! Not a pils. (2.6)
Can. Medium brown. Not much head. The aroma is a bit raisiny, like a kvass or one of the macrobrewed porters they had in Quebec until the 90s. On the palate, it's thin and light. There's a smokey raisin note that I like - and fits with the style quite well - but I don't like how thin it is. The malt character is empty. The bitterness is quite low, lower than it should be for balance. I find the concept of the brewery interesting. I'm all for giving Persia its due - the Cyrus the Great seal is a nice touch - but the beer seems to cut corners. The smokey raisin thing is interesting, reminds a bit of having pasita in Puebla, but the thin cardboardy notes aren't doing it any favours. (2.9)
473ml can. Pours a clear amber-brown with a small, creamy, short lived, beige head that laces. Sweet, spicy aroma of caramel malt, pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, brown sugar and earthy yeast. Sweet, spicy flavour of caramel malt, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, anise, brown sugar, earth and alcohol in a dry, mild bitter finish. Medium body with a sticky, oily texture and average carbonation. Well made and flavourful. (3.4)
Black body with thick white head. Strong bread and coffee notes, a bit too burnt, quite a lot of bitterness. A bit hard to drink, and fig and chocolate is hard to feel as well. (3.0)
DATE: October 16, 2021... OCCASION: watching The Office with the family... GLASSWARE: Chilton Mill willibecker... this pours a bright yellow-orange body with sparse bubbles... its head forms as an off-white, half-fingered head... a brisk spiciness and somewhat dank aroma accompanies the expected caramel and toasted bread that is expected of the style... it body is fresh, easy-drinking, and textured enough to be engaging... nothing exceptional in its profile, but that is the point--it seems the best fests are the ones that stick to the script... this one does offer some garden herb to the flavor... not much else to say--Carton's version is well within the realm of the genre.... (3.4)
The aromas are the best part but still nothing special. And they are apples, spice with a little tea. Flavors are similar to nose, tea comes forward more and doesn't really mesh well with the cider. (2.9)
Can. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is light to medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (lime, blueberry), with a note of Lucky Charms cereal. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Light body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Well, the hop aroma is interesting, and mostly enjoyable, but oddly enough the first impression I got upon pouring was of those artificially flavored neon-colored kids' cereals (Boo Berries, Lucky Charms, etc.). Kinda limp, thin, and sweet (without much to balance the latter) in the mouth, though, so it's not that much fun to drink. And 5.6% is rather high in booze for it to be a sessionable quaffer. Of interest mainly for the hop aroma, but not especially enjoyable otherwise. (3.1)

33 cl, can conditioned, BB March 19th 2022. Hazy, light amber, thick white head, powdery sediments, low carbonation. Aroma is piny and citrusy. Medium mouthfeel, milky, well carbonated and refreshing. Taste is sweet, malty, light citrusy hops, long aftertaste. Very nice low ABV IPA, but is it really a NEIPA?? I don't think so... (3.5)
4 oz draft. Aroma is mild roast, slight oats. The flavor is what you would expect. Soft roast, light chocolate with a mild oat chewy body. Overall, it is a standard brewpub beer but it is executed well enough. (3.5)
Bottle from PINT-tasting. Hazy, orangy brew with frothy off-white head; decent retention. Aroma is red fruits, malty, fruity sour. Taste moderate red fruit, berry, fruity sour, mild bitter-sweet, with light bitter aftertaste. OK carbo. A fresh beer, so for a sunny terrace. Well in balance, the fruit nicely dosed and manufactured in the other elements. Well done. (3.5)
", "Duchesse de Bourgogne pours a dark color with a deep red hue. Its tan head is small, but leaves nice lacing behind. The bouquet is very fruity with vinous notes of muscat, plums, and red berries. The attack is malty but is quickly followed by a light- to medium-bodied mid-palate with vibrant notes of of apple vinegar, cherry, plum, as well as hints of lemon and banana. The hop contributes minimal bitterness that becomes more apparent in the crisp finish. A great and complex brew. (4.2)
On draft at More in Villa Park (2021 vintage). Pours a lightly translucent dark copperish brown with beige head that slowly but steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells and tastes of a robust balance of hops, Maris Otter malt, and oak followed by a bit of vanilla. A touch of cherry on the tongue as well. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, mildly warming, and pleasantly bitter. A tasty sipper. (4.1)
Can: Poured a hazy bright yellow with a white head. Aroma is bold grapefruit, fruity, acidic, pungent. Wow the taste is a tangy bitter punch to the palate of grapefruit, acidic burn in there as well, lingers around. (3.9)

can from mikkeller shop. hazy yellow, white head. delicate citrussy hoppy aroma, crisp malty base, quite fruity, mainly citrus fruits, great citrus hoppy aroma. very american. super nice aroma. flavor is citrussy hoppy, a little bit more herbal than the aroma, lots of citrus going on, also a more herbal or tea like bitterness that kicks in much later than the citrussy notes. perhaps the citrussy notes are not only from hops?. it might be a bit like the citrussy notes you can find in belgian wit. in any case, pretty quenching and quite well tasting beer that is a bit citrus fruit forward (3.6)
Can in the garden, 17th October 2021. Shit the bed it’s a clear, well almost, light golden beer. Aroma is aromatic, pith and pine. Taste is pithy, bitter grapefruit, pith and rind, bitter marmalade, pine resin, not much booze evident. Fantastic and dangerously drinkable. Outstanding stuff. (4.3)
Aroma is citrus, bitter hops, coconut, tropical fruits Pale yellow colour with small head Taste is very balanced with mild bitter hops, lemon, lime, mango, pineapple, and other tropical fruits Smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation Really well balanced! Tasted at home in beder (4.0)
Can, sourced from the barrel room at the brewery and muled to the UK by my bro. Cheers mate! Pours inky black with a thin ring of tan foam. Aroma: huge liquorice/aniseed vibes in the main. Taste: moderate to heavy sweet & moderate bitter, again there's bags of liquorice, also notes of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, whisky barrel. Full body with very light carbonation, oily mouthfeel. Hides that 11% really well. It won't be for everyone but it's right up my strasse. (4.3)
Can thanks to my bro for the pick up. It pours pretty much black with a sturdy dark tan head. The aroma is rich roasted malt, burnt pine, umami, liquorice, light ash, splash of tropical fruits, mango, peach, berry and fruit cake. The taste is dry, bitterness which lingers, charred pine, rich roasted malt, umami, peppery spice, liquorice, tropical fruits, twist of citrus, berries, green, dank and sticky with a dry, roasted finale. Medium body and average carbonation. Works well for. Flavourful, but also rather drinkable for the style. (3.7)
Rating from old records. On tap at brewery for 2nd Bday (Dec'19) in shaker. Pours hazy orange w/frothy off-white head that laced well, pine & citrus aroma. Trop fruity taste, soft mouthfeel, light bitterness. (3.7)
Bottle from Cork & Cask. Hazy golden body with a white head. Lively carbonation. Good lacing. Aroma of cucumber and underripe pear. Flavour of grass and green vegetable notes. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Soft fizz. Clean, crisp and hides the alcohol very well. (3.8)
Can. Murky golden body with a white head. Low carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of peach and white candy sticks. Flavour of orange pulp, dried mango and pine. Medium to full body with a smooth mouthfeel. Soft fizz. This is ripe and juicy. Overtone do big hoppy beers very well. (4.1)
Aroma of roasted grain, maple syrup, pancake, vanilla and chocolate. A beautiful violent nitro pour with a large cascade that ends up in a couple fingers of a creamy beige head with very high retention and laces on the glass. Sweet, but not overly, with a roasty flavour of cacao and grain, maple syrup, vanilla, spices and chocolate. Good balance and rich. Creamy mouthfeel, very smooth nitro carbonation, excellent easy drink. When a nitro pour is well achieved, this type of stout is a great treat, smooth and tasty. Afternoon Sunday drink. (4.0)
Pint can. Spicy yeast aroma with notes of lemony citrus, white wine, pepper, straw and oak. Pours cloudy golden colored with a large off white head that has excellent retention and good lacing. Starts with white wine, straw and pepper flavors as well as having a lively mouthfeel. Finishes dry but still smooth with spicy yeast, lemony citrus and oak flavors. Really nice farmhouse. (4.3)
Aroma of citrus, passion fruit, yellow stone fruits. Malts is neutral biscuit, just a support for the Simcoe showcase. Hazy orange, large white head, foamy and long lasting, a lot of sediment. Moderate bitterness, and some sweetness from hops and malts as usual for these high ABV IPAs. Not a hop juice, but citrus, passion fruit and apricot are parte of the show. Full bodied, creamy, smooth, ABV that grows sip after sip, medium carbonation, functional to the trick. Solid beer, very well made, round and tasty. (4.0)
On tap at Parallel 49, pours a hazy dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma brings out caramel, some dried red fruits, and bready malt. Flavour is quite rich, with lots of caramel, a bit of dried fruit, and bready toffee. Very malty and well-rounded. I prefer this version without the salt — very good. (3.7)
Aroma of black currant, massive, behind it, emerges the power of Mosaic hops, with evident tropical and floral notes. Vanilla completes the picture. Pours magenta red, large creamy pink head, high retention and beautiful rings of lacing. Sour, black currant dominated, but with a strong mosaic hoppy character (tropical fruits). Vanilla and milk sugar are the least interesting part for me, but they are essential in this brew, as a sweet balance to the sourness by yeast and black currant. Medium body, tingling carbonation and hidden ABV make this dangerously easy to drink. Very well made for its style and packed with flavours. It does what it says. Coherent beer. (4.2)
Pint can, thanks Craig & Sarah! Pineapple aroma with notes of lychee, coconut, mango and tangerine. Pours clear golden colored with a large off white head that has excellent retention and good lacing. Starts with juicy pineapple, lychee and mango flavors. Finishes smooth but a bit dry with coconut and tangerine flavors as well as some floral hop bitterness. Really nice and well balanced. (4.2)
Can to tulip glass. Moderate dank and citrus blend well on the aroma. Hazy orange-gold with white head. Flavor is orange and faint marmalade. Vibrant citrus. (3.8)
Aromas of heavy chocolate cocoa nibs charcoal roasted malts roasted barley strawberry raspberry vanilla and milk. Taste is tons of milk vanilla marshmallow flavor creamy body chocolate cocoa nibs cacao bark toffee tree bark coffee roasted dark malts roasted barley strawberry raspberry and charcoal. Overall, a big step up from their original 5X stout. Really good and well balanced. (3.8)
Full-bodied aroma of orange and grapefruit. Creamy and luscious mouthfeel with only a hint of orange peel bitterness at the finish. Loads of fresh citrus on the tongue with a bit of weed as well. Most excellent (4.3)
16oz can from Arrow - Mason, canned 9/27/21. Nice, big bright unique hop here. Peach, grapefruit, sabro coconut, floral and light pine. A lot less malty and more well-balanced than expected, definitely hop forward. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, light to moderate sweet. Bigger body, full, hop-forward. Kind of creamy actually, hey wait is this a hazy IPA? Does look not clear... Has a bit of that influence but I'm ok with that. Elevated bitterness is there as well as some sweet malt so we can call it west-coast. Maybe they call it west-coast because it uses some classic C-hops, that's fine too. Great head rentention and lace. Really nice overall and great with my sandwich, enjoyed this a good bit more than I expected to. (4.0)
Jet black pour with a few inches of brown down head. Sweet aroma of maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, licorice, coffee and more. Alcohol taste is pretty strong and not as well masked as I would prefer. Nonetheless, this one's got intensely strong cocoa stout flavor. Loads of dark chocolate, dark fruits, cocoa, maple and brown sugar are attempted to be balanced by a strong roasted malt character. Bourbon barrel flavor really comes out strong. At 12% it's obviously a sipper. The cinnamon and vanilla are detectable, but not really enough of a focal point in the finished product to include them in the name. Thick and luxurious mouthfeel. The bittersweet angle works here somewhat. If there is a negative to this beer, it's so big and there is a lot of moving parts in the flavor profile. Overall I have to say the finish is good, as promised it is not ruined by too much sweetness. A good one. (4.4)

It pours very dark brown, almost black. It has a medium brown head with good head retention. There are some strong plum aromas up front with roast and coffee. It has a sweetness in the aroma as well. It has strong roast and some coffee up front with a light burnt flavor. There are medium plum flavors with strong alcohol. It has a full body with strong alcohol warming that veers into a hot side. (Lightly) Overall, nice flavors with a little more on the burnt side that I like, but still produces a decent finish overall. (3.6)
Bottle from PINT-tasting, pouring reasonably clear gold, with white head, retaining quite well. Nice aroma of spicy yeast, malts, typical tripel. Taste has a nice balance in bitter and sweet. Fine carbo, rather full mouth. Very nice tripel; surprisingly well done! (3.9)
Big coffee aromas, boozy with an odd floral note.Medium brown color with a light tan head, way more bubbles than I expected. The coffee bitterness plays well with the chocolate, vanilla and booze heat. The palate is thinner than I like but smooth anyway. Good one. (3.7)

One of my overall favorite beers. Very clean. Very well balanced. Close to perfect. I would compare to my favorite beer, Paulaner Lager. (4.9)
